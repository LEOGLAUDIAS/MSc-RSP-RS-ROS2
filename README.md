Robotics Simulations Using ROS2 (TheConstruct.ai)

The purpose of this project was to design, implement, and test a simulated autonomous robot system using the TheConstruct.ai ROS2 workspace. The problem addressed was enabling a differential drive robot to navigate a maze-like environment while avoiding obstacles and interacting with a human operator.

Objectives:
- Develop a ROS2 workspace with a custom maze world.
- Integrate multiple sensors (LIDAR, IMU).
- Implement autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- Provide Humanâ€“Robot Interaction (HRI) via teleoperation.
- Design a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to control behaviour.
- Evaluate robustness with multiple test runs.
